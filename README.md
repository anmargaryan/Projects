## Digital Dice Project

An electronic dice built using basic digital logic components. The circuit simulates a rolling dice and displays numbers from 1 to 6 using a 7-segment display.

### Components Used
- 555 Timer (Astable mode)
- 4017 Decade Counter
- 7447 BCD to 7-Segment Decoder
- 7-Segment Display (Common Cathode)
- Resistors, Capacitors, Push Button

### Project Overview
- Clock pulses from a 555 timer feed into a 4017 counter to simulate dice outcomes.
- A 7447 decoder translates BCD output to drive the 7-segment display.
- A push button starts and stops the rolling sequence.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Digital logic design and timing circuits  
- IC interfacing and 7-segment control  
- Breadboarding, circuit testing, and debugging

## Gauss Gun Project

A simple electromagnetic launcher that demonstrates how a coilgun works using capacitor discharge.

### Components Used
- Capacitor 
- Setp-up transformer 
- Hand-wound copper coil
- Diode 
- Push button
- Metal projectile 
- Basic frame for holding the coil and guiding the projectile

### Project Overview
- The capacitor is charged using a camera flash circuit.
- When the button is pressed, the capacitor discharges through the coil.
- The magnetic field pulls and launches the metal projectile through the barrel.
- The goal was to experiment with electromagnetic force.
### Skills Demonstrated
- Basic electromagnetic principles  
- Safe handling of high-voltage components  
- Hands-on circuit assembly and troubleshooting
